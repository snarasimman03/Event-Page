## Project 1: Event Page

In the first project, we will build an Event Page that will cover a wide range of fundamental HTML components. Throughout this project, you will learn how to use the following HTML elements:

- Heading Tags: `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, `<h4>`, `<h5>`, `<h6>`
- Paragraph Tags: `<p>`
- Anchor Tags: `<a>`
- Body Tag: `<body>`
- HTML Boilerplate: `<html>`
- Image Tag: `<img>`

By the end of this project, you will have a clear understanding of how to structure basic HTML elements and create an appealing Event Page.
